## *Time for bootstrap!*

In this project, we will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that we learned previously.

We won’t have a lot of instruction, we are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

# *Here the final result:*
